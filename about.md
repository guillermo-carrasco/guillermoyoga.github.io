I’m a long-time yogi who recently completed my 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training at Abhaya Yoga in NYC.

My first yoga class, years ago, was just curiosity — I wanted a structured way to “stretch my body.” I left that class not only feeling better physically, but with an unexpected sense of calm and clarity.

Since then, I’ve explored many studios and styles of yoga. Over time I realized that a well-structured class — one that’s engaging and anatomically sound — is not only more fun, but also safer for our bodies. That curiosity about safe, effective movement eventually led me to teacher training.

I’ve always been passionate about movement: running, hiking, mountaineering, martial arts, climbing — you name it. Yoga, though, is unique. It’s not only a complete physical practice, but also a philosophy that resonates deeply with me: openness, acceptance, and compassion.

In my classes you’ll flow and sweat, because I love heat and strength. That said, I always offer options. My goal is to create a safe, playful, and supportive environment where students can express themselves and be their own yogis.

Yoga has become a life-changing practice for me, and I can’t wait to share what I’ve learned with you — and to learn from you as well, because we all have something to teach.

See you in class!
