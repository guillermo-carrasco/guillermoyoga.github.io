I'm a long-time yogi who recently completed my 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training at Abhaya Yoga in Brooklyn. The practice started as curiosity -- a structured way to "stretch my body" after long days at a desk -- and quickly became a source of clarity, presence, and community.

## Teaching philosophy

- **Strong, supportive sequencing.** I love building heat and strength, but I never sacrifice safety. I break down shapes, offer options, and invite students to listen in.
- **Breath-led movement.** Flow is more than choreography -- it's moving with intention. I use steady pacing and clear cues to help practitioners stay grounded in their breath.
- **Playful curiosity.** Whether we're exploring new transitions or pausing in stillness, I encourage students to notice, feel, and respond with compassion.

## Beyond the mat

Movement has always been my thing -- running, hiking, mountaineering, martial arts, climbing -- but yoga offers something different. It's equal parts discipline and surrender; it invites openness, acceptance, and the courage to meet yourself exactly where you are. That's what keeps me coming back, and what I hope to share in every class.

I can't wait to keep growing as a teacher and to learn from the communities I get to serve. See you in class!
