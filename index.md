Hi, I’m Guillermo — a yoga teacher trained at Abhaya Yoga in NYC. My classes are strong, playful, and welcoming to all levels. 

Expect to move, sweat, and explore your own expression on the mat in a safe, supportive space.

## Where to find me? 

I am currently teaching regularly as part of my full-time job fitness program at my office. Unfortunately this is on a 
private setting so it is not open to the general public.

I'd love to explore opportunities to teach in studios around the city! Let me know if you're open to hear about what I can
offer, say hi@guillermoyoga.com
